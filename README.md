A Python program for playing sounds based on button input on Raspberry Pis. It has been tested on the Raspberry Pi 4, but should work with other Pis too. 

The program presents a recurring menu that allows playback of previously recorded sounds, or the option to create a new recording. Only one recording at a time is currently supported. The program will play sounds as input occurs.

Any bug reports or feature requests are welcome and encouraged and can be handled through the issues or pull requests tabs.
